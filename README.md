# NEAT
NEAT library writen in C (and some C++)

In the NEAT branch there are 3 files:
	
# neat2.h

This is the main header file, you can include it to your code by typing #include"neat2.h"

Note : (Tested Versions : Windows 10 , Kali Linux 5.6.0) You have to include the graphics.h library into your project

# neat.h

This is an old version of the neat2.h library , just included for testing , debugging, to show how the library was evolved and ... why not?

# headless-neat2.h

This is a copy of neat2.h that is used by systems that do not support graphics.h library
